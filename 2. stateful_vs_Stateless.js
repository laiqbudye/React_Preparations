// What do you mean by Stateful vs Stateless components.

// the components which handles state inside them are called as Stateful components / container components.

// Historically class-based components were stateful components because in the previous version of react only class components are supposed to play with state.

// but in react V16.8, hooks got introduced and using useState() we can now handle state in functional components also.

// so coming back to our qustion, the components who are handling state inside them are referred as stateful components.

// the components which does not manage state inside them are referred as stateless components / presemtational components / dumb components. they only view something on page
//  based on data they get
