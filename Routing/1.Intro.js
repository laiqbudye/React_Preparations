What is Routing?
Routing is the ability to move between different parts of an application when a user enters a URL or clicks an element (link, button, icon, image etc) within the application.

Packages we need to use:- 
=> react-router: the core library.
=> react-router-dom: a variant of the core library meant to be used for web applications.
=> react-router-native: a variant of the core library used with react native in the development of Android and iOS applications.

Often, there is no need to install the core react-router library by itself, but rather a choice is made between react-router-dom and react-router-native, depending on the situation. 
Both react-router-dom and react-router-native import all the functionality of the core react-router library.

These packages are not created by Facebook but these pkgs are standard to use in react for routing.

to install this pkg:- npm install --save react-router-dom
